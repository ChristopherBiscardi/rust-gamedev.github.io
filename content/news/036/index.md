Welcome to the 36th issue of the Rust GameDev Workgroup's
monthly newsletter.
[Rust] is a systems language pursuing the trifecta:
safety, concurrency, and speed.
These goals are well-aligned with game development.
We hope to build an inviting ecosystem for anyone wishing
to use Rust in their development process!

_Creating mountains from planes with vertex shaders and Bevy_

[@chrisbiscardi] published a
[video][Creating mountains from planes with vertex shaders and Bevy]
about using the new Material shader APIs in Bevy 0.8 to transform the
vertex positions in a custom mesh plane using a vertex shader.

_What's in a wgsl fragment shader? ft Bevy_

[@chrisbiscardi] published a [video][What's in a wgsl fragment shader? ft Bevy]
that introduces the new Material APIs in Bevy 0.8. It covers AsBindGroup,
uniforms, and using Perlin Noise in a fragment shader to render different
colors onto a cube in a variety of ways.

## Tooling Updates

### [Blackjack]

![Blackjack: A procedural bridge being edited in real-time](blackjack.gif)

[Blackjack] by @setzer22 is a new procedural modeling application made in Rust,
using rend3, wgpu, and egui. It follows the steps of applications like
Houdini, or Blender's geometry nodes project and provides a node-based
environment to compose procedural recipes to create 3d models.

The focus for the past few months has been into evolving Blackjack from a proof
of concept into a usable application. It's current status is not yet production
ready, but it can now be used to build complex procedural models editable inside
a game engine thanks to its new engine integration system.

Some of the new features include:

- A better data model for meshes, based on groups and channels.
- Game engine integration with Godot, more engines coming soon.
- Introduce Lua as an extension language.
- Add *many* new nodes: Extrude along curve, Copy to points...
- Add experimental support for L-Systems.
- Reworked Look & Feel

A talk about Blackjack's vision and a tour of its features was shared at the
start of July in the [Rust gamedev meetup][blackjack-talk-yt]. Interested
developers are encouraged to [check the project out on GitHub][Blackjack] and
post on the Discussion boards!
